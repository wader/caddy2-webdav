# caddy2-webdav 

Experiment based on https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-webdav for testing

# TODO

Figure out why `webdav` directive don't get url/prefix argument if starting with a /.

OPTIONS method and `log stdout` not working. `Allow` headers etc gets stripped.

Fix module url path.

Use structs from github.com/hacdias/webdav/v3/lib but has to be modified with json annotations etc?

Tests?
